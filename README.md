This code uses Tkinter to create a user registration form that collects user data and stores it in an Excel file (.xlsx). Additionally, it allows users to view the entered data in a table within the graphical interface.

Explanation of the main elements in the code:

Registration Interface:

Captures information such as first name, last name, email, password, cellphone number, and age.
Utilizes a Spinbox to capture the age input.
Includes a checkbox to accept terms and conditions.
Functionalities:

Shows/hides the password when clicking the "show password" option.
Performs validations on form fields.
Saves user data to an Excel file (data.xlsx).
Loads data from the Excel file into the interface for visualization.
Data Visualization:

Utilizes the Treeview component to display data in a table format.
Features a scrollbar to view data beyond the widget's size.
Load Data Functionality:

Checks if the Excel file already exists; if not, creates a new file and adds column titles.
Loads data from the Excel file into the visualization interface.
"Register" Button:

Upon being pressed, executes the enterData function that checks filled fields and saves data to the Excel file.
Updates the data view in the table.
Other Details:

Organizes interface elements using Frame to separate sections of the form.
To run this code, the openpyxl library needs to be installed. If you don't have this library installed, you can install it via pip using the command pip install openpyxl.

Execute the code in a Python environment to see and interact with the interface. Observe the behavior of the registration form and the data display in the table.
